Phishing campaigns have grown more complex, 
focusing on human psychological traits like stress, haste, and 
curiosity in addition to technical flaws. In order to assess a user's 
vulnerability to phishing, this research proposes a novel method 
that combines behavioral analysis with machine learning. The 
Random Forest Classifier underwent training and testing on 
phishing-related technological characteristics and behavioral 
psychological factors using a set of data generated by the LLM, 
and it achieved a 99.5% success rate. These results are also 
incorporated by research into a dashboard hosted on a web 
server for evaluating risks in real time via a flask backend. The 
findings highlight how important the need is to address the 
influence of human factor in cybersecurity and show how 
integrating technical as well as psychological aspects can lead to 
more successful phishing detection as well as prevention.
